## General Idea

The core gameplay loop involves delving into a procedurally generated dungeon, with a persistent hub town (Anamne) serving as a base for preparation and respite. A tutorial introduces the mechanics within a fixed-layout dungeon.

## Mechanics

* **Preparation:** Players use the hub town to prepare for dungeon runs, including selling loot, learning skills, and upgrading equipment.

## General Controls

* **Movement:** Left/Right (Horizontal), Up (Jump), Down (Fall/Drop through Platform)
* **Attack:** Basic Melee Attack, Special Magic Attack
* **Menu:** Pause
* **Inventory:** Use/Switch Items and Equipment

## Dungeon Features

## Narrative

Driven by the promise of wealth and fame, players take on the role of a dungeon explorer venturing into the mysterious, ever-shifting depths of the dungeon. The dungeon, however, exacts a peculiar price: amnesia. Explorers emerge with no memory of the layout or their experiences within. To combat this, they meticulously document their journeys in notebooks and journals, relying on these records to piece together the dungeon's secrets and survive its treacherous depths. The ever-changing nature of the dungeon renders old maps and layouts useless, adding to the challenge and mystery.
